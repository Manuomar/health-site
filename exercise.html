<h2>Physical activity has significant health benefits for hearts, bodies and minds. 
</h2>
It contributes to preventing and managing noncommunicable diseases such as
cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes. 
Physical activity reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety and enhances
 thinking, learning, and judgment skills.
Being physically active can improve your brain health, help manage weight, reduce
the risk of disease, strengthen bones and muscles, and improve your ability to do 
everyday activities 
Regular physical activity is one of the most important things you can do for your health

You can exercise at home without any equipment by practicing yoga poses and 
strength training exercises that use your body weight for resistance.

Here’s a beginner routine you can try at home:

Bodyweight squats: 20 reps
Push-ups: 10 reps
Walking lunges: 10 each leg

    <h1>Strength Training</h1>

Strength training involves lifting weights or using resistance bands to 
build muscle and strength. It can help improve bone density, 
reduce the risk of osteoporosis, and increase metabolism.

<h2>Push-ups</h2>
<pre>
Push-ups are a great exercise that can help build upper body strength and tone several muscles 
including the chest,shoulders, triceps, and core. Here are the steps to perform a proper push-up:
Begin in a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your feet hip-width apart.
 Your body should be in a straight line from your head to your heels.    
Lower your body down towards the ground by bending your elbows. Keep your body straight and your core engaged.    
When your chest is just above the ground, push yourself back up to the starting position by extending your arms.    
Repeat for a desired number of repetitions.    
Here are some tips to keep in mind while performing push-ups:    
Keep your elbows close to your sides as you lower your body down towards the ground. 
This will help target your triceps and prevent strain on your shoulders.    
Keep your core engaged throughout the exercise to maintain proper form and protect your lower back.    
If you are unable to perform a full push-up, you can modify the exercise by performing push-ups
 from your knees instead of your feet.    
To make the exercise more challenging, you can perform push-ups with your hands elevated on a bench or step,
 or with your feet elevated on a bench or stability ball.    
It's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. If you experience any pain or discomfort, 
stop the exercise and consult with a healthcare provider.
