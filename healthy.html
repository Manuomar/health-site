A healthy diet is essential for maintaining good health and preventing 
chronic diseases. It involves consuming a variety of nutrient-rich foods 
in appropriate portions to meet the body's nutritional needs.
Here are some key principles of a healthy diet:
<h3>Balance</h3>
Include a balance of different food groups, such as fruits, vegetables, 
whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Each group provides 
essential nutrients that contribute to overall health.

<h3>Variety</h3>
Consume a wide range of foods within each food group to ensure a diverse intake of nutrients.
Different foods contain different combinations of vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals, 
which are beneficial for your health.

<h3>Fruit and vegetables</h3>
Aim to include a variety of fruits and vegetables in your daily diet.
They are packed with vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants.
Try to have different colors of fruits and vegetables to get a wider range of nutrients.
<h3>Whole grains</h3>
Choose whole grains like whole wheat, brown rice, oats, and quinoa over refined grains.
Whole grains are higher in fiber and other nutrients, which can help with digestion 
and provide sustained energy.
<h3>Lean proteins</h3>
Include lean sources of protein such as poultry, fish, beans, lentils, tofu, 
and low-fat dairy products. Protein is essential for building and repairing tissues, 
and it also helps keep you feeling full.
<h3>Healthy fats</h3>
Incorporate sources of healthy fats like avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and 
fatty fish (such as salmon and tuna). These fats are beneficial for heart health
and help in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.

<h3>Limit added sugars</h3>
Minimize your intake of foods and drinks that are high in added sugars,
such as sugary beverages, candies, pastries, and processed snacks. 
Opt for natural sugars found in fruits instead.
<h3>Reduce salt intake</h3>
Limit your consumption of sodium by avoiding excessive salt and salty processed foods.
High sodium intake can contribute to high blood pressure and other health issues.
<h3>Stay hydrated</h3>
Drink plenty of water throughout the day to maintain proper hydration.
Limit sugary drinks and opt for water as your primary beverage.
