each other and are often practiced together to achieve a harmonious and 
balanced state of being.Here's a brief overview of both practices:

Padmasana is the Sanskrit name for a renowned yoga asana, otherwise known as Lotus Pose.
It is a seated posture, in which the legs are crossed and the feet are positioned on top 
of the opposite thighs at the hip crease. The term is derived from two Sanskrit roots; padma, 
meaning "lotus" and asana meaning "seat" or "posture".
